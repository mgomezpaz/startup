# Free Secure Code

[My Notes](notes.md)

This is a web application that allows users to upload a folder of code, analyzes it using the OpenAI GPT API, and provides insights into potential vulnerabilities and suggestions for improvement. This tool is designed to implement simple, fast, and secure code analyisis using the latest AI technologies.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to know if your code is secure? Code Vulnerability Analyzer is a simple web tool that enables developers to identify and resolve security vulnerabilities in a matter of seconds. By uploading a folder containing your code, you can receive detailed AI reports, highlighting weaknesses and providing some recommendations for improvement. Whether you're working on a small project or a large-scale application, this tool ensures your code meets high-security standards.

### Design

![Design image](design.png)

Here is a conceptual design of the workflow:
1. Users upload a compressed folder of their code.
2. The server extracts its contents and processes each file.
3. The OpenAI GPT API is used to analyze the files for vulnerabilities.
4. Results are displayed on a dashboard.

    actor User
    actor WebApp
    User->>WebApp: Upload a ZIP folder
    WebApp->>Server: Send the folder to the server
    Server->>GPT_API: Analyze code files
    GPT_API-->>Server: Return vulnerability analysis
    Server-->>WebApp: Send results to display
    WebApp-->>User: Show vulnerability insights and suggestions
```

### Key features

- Secure Upload: Users can upload a compressed folder containing their codebase securely.
- AI-Powered Analysis: The application integrates with the OpenAI GPT API to analyze the code for common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, XSS, and weak encryption.
- Detailed Reports: Generates actionable suggestions for improving code security.
- Dashboard: Allows users to explore vulnerabilities file by file, with severity ratings and improvement tips.
- Real-Time Feedback: Uses WebSocket to show the progress of analysis as it happens.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Two HTML pages. One for login and one for the code analyzer dashboard.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, file uploads, real-time analysis progress, and report displays.
- **Service** - Integrates the OpenAI GPT API for analyzing code files.
Uses third-party libraries for handling ZIP file uploads and extraction.
- **DB/Login** - Implements user authentication for secure access to the application.
Stores user-uploaded files and analysis history in a database for reference.
- **WebSocket** - Provides real-time feedback to users during the analysis process, such as displaying progress and results as they are generated.
